about: The issue tracker is not for support questions, use GitHub discussions Q&A instead
---

The issue tracker is used to advance the development of Lighthouse.
Issues that are neither detailed bug reports nor well-thought-out feature proposals will be closed.

You can use [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/nuwave/lighthouse/discussions) to [ask support questions](https://github.com/nuwave/lighthouse/discussions/new?category=q-a).
